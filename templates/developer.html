<p>Hello, we are a team of passionate AI and Machine Learning students at JECRC University. We are dedicated to harnessing the power of technology to make a positive impact on people's lives. Allow us to share a bit about our journey in the world of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
</p>

<h5>Our Expertise</h5>
<p>With a strong academic background in computer science and a deep fascination for AI and ML, we have worked on diverse and innovative projects. This Disease Prediction System represents our commitment to applying machine learning techniques to solve real-world healthcare challenges.
</p>

<h5>A Commitment to Excellence</h5>
<p>Our work is driven by a commitment to excellence and a belief that technology should be accessible and beneficial to everyone. Whether it's developing predictive models, creating intelligent algorithms, or designing user-friendly interfaces, we strive for solutions that are both cutting-edge and user-centric.
</p>

<h5>Passion for Health Tech</h5>
<p>The development of this Disease Prediction System represents a convergence of our passion for AI and our dedication to improving healthcare accessibility. We believe that AI has the potential to transform the way we approach healthcare, making it more personalized and informative. This platform is a testament to that vision.
</p>

<h5>Project Details</h5>
<p>This project uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained on 4,920 medical records with 132 symptoms to predict among 41 different diseases. The system achieves 100% accuracy on the test dataset and provides comprehensive health recommendations including precautions, medications, diet plans, and workout suggestions.
</p>

<h5>Join Us on this Journey</h5>
<p>We invite you to explore this Disease Prediction System and experience firsthand the fusion of AI and healthcare. Together, we can empower individuals with knowledge, promote well-being, and contribute to a brighter and healthier future.
